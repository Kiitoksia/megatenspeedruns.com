## Glitches & Tricks
<details>
<summary>**MP Cheat**</summary>

When selecting "attack" while selecting a certain character's action, hold select to have that character use its strongest attack without using MP - also works with demons. To have this happen during AUTO, hold "select" when choosing "AUTO".
