        <Steps>
            1. Persona 5 Royal was released in Japan on October 31, 2019.
            2. The first recorded run was done by Liv with a time of [**19:42:24**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/519987799).
            3. 18 days later, Darkkefka achieved a better time with a [**17:51:39**]. The VOD is no longer available.

            5. On 2020/2/11, an unintentional race would begin between Liv and DarkKefka, who had both somehow managed to begin a streamed run attempt miraculously at the same time with no communication. This race came down to the wire when both runners reached the final boss with only 2 minutes between them. Kefka had started the final boss ahead of Liv but, using a slightly updated final boss strategy, Liv was able to close that gap and almost pass Kefka before tragedy struck. A basic attack input was accidentally entered at an extremely inopportune time resulting in a death. Kefka went ahead to secure the record with a [**16:42:32**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN6Ny0cM7BQ)
            6. On 2020/3/6, Liv set a new record time of [**16:22:06**](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/563143319)

            10. May was a very eventful much for P5R speedrunning as Liv continued the back and forth 14 days later and claimed the record to a time of [**15:35:36**](https://youtu.be/ssAz7xBdnok)

            15. But Liv began 2021 shocking everyone with a new grasp at the record with her [**14:39:51**](https://youtu.be/NrfB4tHgLHQ)
            16. Liv improved the record close to 6 months later in the first run to utilise out of bounds glitches, with a [14:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSggYIdRWbw)

## Glitches and Tricks
<details>
<summary>Final Boss (Maruki) Cheese</summary>

The Maruki cheese involves using a persona with both repel physical and repel light. This renders you completely invulnerable to all but 2 of Maruki's attacks, one of which he'll only be able to use a single time in his 1st phase and the other he will only use twice in his 2nd phase. The second half of the cheese involves getting a persona with Endure (or using Boss Undies), and another with Enduring Soul, which allows you to survive his Tyrant Chaos attack for free both times. This cheese is significant as up until this point Maruki was requiring runners perform significant prep work throughout their route, as well as generally being a nuisance to fight.

The initial setup of this cheese was found by Liv, in early February of 2020.

<summary>Out of Bounds</summary>

Out of Bounds involves going outside of the intended boundaries of the game world, and can be used to sequence break a game. In Persona 5 Royal, this largely involves skipping over boss fights. One particularly Out of Bounds in Royal works very similarly to the original Persona 5. Namely, we utilize the collision of shadows to force us out of bounds.

This involves having a shadow push us into the ground via its collision, enabling us to lose height, clip underneath the map and move to areas we normally shouldn't be able to access at that point.

Usually, this is done by climbing up a ledge at the right moment, sliding underneath an object at the right movement or, most typically, running between a shadow and another object it is very close to, such as a wall or pillar and pause buffering a throwable item at the right moment. Other ways can involve abusing systems in the game that will automatically take control of Joker after positioning a shadow correctly, such as banging on a door, opening a door or pressing a button.

Once you're out of bounds you can access other areas by using two differing methods to both lose height and gain height again. To lose height after clipping out of bounds you want to run in triangular motions very rapidly, and to gain height you want to pivot Joker in a specific way and at a specific angle. 

There were many people involved in both the discovery and full utilisation of out of bounds in Persona 5 Royal and they all deserve a mention, here are some of the accomplishments below and the people involved. This will only be including skips currently involved in the run (or can be) and/or skips that involve making the run faster.
