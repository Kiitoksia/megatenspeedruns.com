<summary>**PS1 Manip**</summary>
                          
Used to make boss fights more consistent.
If you save in front of the door, reset the game and load the save, the upcoming boss fight should go according to the certain scenario.
That allows you to kill the boss with the tools you have while being severely underleveled.
