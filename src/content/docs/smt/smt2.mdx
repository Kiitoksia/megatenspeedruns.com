<Steps>
1. Shin Megami Tensei II was released in Japan on March 14, 1994.
2. The oldest available recorded speedrun was done by ドミネーター on 2014/03/31 with a time of [**1:52:23**](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm23225176). This run used the traesto warp bug and item change to go to Makai early into the game and cut the entirety of the Tokyo Underground section of the game.
3. On 2020/02/08, lradial beat the world record with a time of [**1:51:34**](https://youtu.be/jvyvaGTwifA)
4. On 2022/08/08, known glitch hunter and speedrunner masaya published a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCxKqoqmi2E&t=13s) explaining how to access the in-game debug menu. This led to the creation of a new Any% category which completed the game unlocking and accessing this debug menu while still using item change and traesto warp.
5. On 2022/08/13, Symm completed this new route and achieved a new world record with a time of [37:32](https://youtu.be/nZ0KfUkVnpI)
