## Glitches & Tricks
<details>
<summary>Astaroth Castle Warp</summary>
If you meet with Balam in Shibuya with under 7 Wisdom then use Taestro and talk to the receptionist again, you will somehow end up in Astaroth's Castle. This bug causes some issues that need to be worked around. For example, you must have the party filled after killing Astaroth and you must kill Heroine before you leave the castle.

<details>
<summary>Auto-Pilot Bug</summary>
If you set an auto-pilot location and then being returning to the location you have the option to cancel it before you reach the initial location. By cancelling it this way you will be able to walk around feely but with no encounters for the entire dungeon. It resets after you leave to the world map. [Video example.](https://x.com/SymmRTA/status/1683684048911097857)

<details>
<summary>Total Annihilation Bug</summary>
Total Annihilation is the name of a saved game corruption bug that allows you to beat the game in under 10 minutes. It is currently not used or recorded on SRC, you can find an example of it [here](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm37779525).
