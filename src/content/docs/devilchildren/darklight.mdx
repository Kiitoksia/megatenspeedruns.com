## Glitches and Tricks
<details>
<summary>**Guard Skip**</summary>

The guard that blocks the way to Avalon can be bypassed by moving diagonally across him. This can be reproduced in both versions of the game and allows the player to access lategame items much earlier than intended. It is also possible to go fight the last boss fight from there at any moment.

<details>
<summary>**Encounter despawn**</summary>

By pressing select to open the map, the internal encounter counter is reset to zero. By doing so in a rhythm, it is possible to avoid all random encounters.
